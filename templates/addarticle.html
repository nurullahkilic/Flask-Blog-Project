    <h2>Taj Mahal: A breathtaking ode to love</h2>
    <p>
      No trip to India is complete without visiting this spectacular monument,
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New7Wonders_of_the_World"
        ><strong>counted among the Seven Wonders of the World</strong></a
      >.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tourists frequently admit that Taj Mahal "simply cannot be described with
      words". And that’s probably true. The more you try the more speechless you
      become. Words give only a semblance of truth. The real truth about its
      beauty is revealed when you adore
      <strong
        >different shades of “Taj” depending on the time of the day</strong
      >
      or when you admire the exquisite inlay work in different corners of the
      façade.
    </p>
    <h3>Masterpiece of the world’s heritage</h3>
    <p>
      Taj Mahal is a mausoleum built in Agra between 1631 and 1648 by Emperor
      Shah Jahan
      <strong>in the memory of his beloved wife</strong>, Mumtaz Mahal, whose
      body lies there. It took 20 000 workers to complete and the excellence of
      this building is visible in every brick.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1983, Taj Mahal was appointed
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Heritage_Site"
        >UNESCO World Heritage Site</a
      >
      for being "the jewel of Muslim art in India and one of the universally
      admired masterpieces of the world's heritage".
    </p>
    <p>
      If you like having a methodology for visiting historical places, here are
      the four elements on which we recommend to focus your attention:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The tomb</li>
      <li>The Decorations</li>
      <li>The Garden</li>
      <li>The Outlying buildings</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The tomb is what immediately catches your eyesight. The
      <strong>white and soft marble</strong> embroidered with stones leaves you
      totally enchanted.
